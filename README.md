# 📛 Project Name and Purpose
Work Day Scheduler

In this project, we were asked to implement the skills learned throughout Module 5 to complete a work day scheduler. 

## 💡Acceptance Criteria

It is done when...

* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

* The user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.

* Each block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

* The user is able to enter an event when they click on a time block.

* The text for the event is saved in local storage.
